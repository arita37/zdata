aufgrund der neuen gesetzlichen Lage habe ich meine Angebote umgestellt auf eine Mindestdauer der Miete von 3 Monaten. Alles ander ist ab dem 01.05.2016 leider nicht mehr legal. Ihr erhaltet natürlich einen Mietvertrag, mit dem Ihr Euch beim zuständigen Bürgeramt anmelden solltet.

Ihr könnt meine Wohnungen also ab sofort längerfristig mieten. Das ist ideal für Erasmusstudenten, längere berufliche Aufenthalte oder bspw. um in Berlin eine erste Bleibe zu finden :)



Dear everybody,

I changed my conditions to a minimum stay of 2 months due to the new law in place since May 1st 2016. You will be handed over a proper rental agreement so you will be able to register yourself at the ""Bürgeramt"".

Besides  that, I am still trying to make my places look and feel not only clean & comfortable, but also to add a special touch to them, so YOU hopefully feel at ease from the first moment on.

I'm constantly trying to improve, often only on details, to make everything just a touch better so you have a good start in Berlin :)



Apart from that I'm part of a multicultural couple and speak various languages more or less well. So at least one of us is quite sure to be able to communicate with YOU if the standard english is not sufficient:)

About the area: Countless pubs, restaurants, cafés, galleries and little shops create a day and nightlife atmosphere unrivalled in the rest of Berlin. Along with Schöneberg and Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg is a focal point of the Berlin art scene. Along with Friedrichshain and Kreuzberg it is also a popular neighbourhood with the student population. Prenzlauer Berg is one of the most popular central districts in Berlin and one of the prettiest neighbourhoods, still central, yet quieter than Berlin Mitte. Much of Prenzlauer Berg escaped damage in the second world war and post war redevelopment. Nowadays Prenzlauer Berg offers trendy shopping with many street style fashion designers selling their wares in trendy boutiques.","SINCE JAN 1st 2014 BERLIN HAS INTRODUCED A ""TOURIST TAX"" (5% of the Netto Price + VAT) THAT HAS TO BE PAID DIRECTLY TO THE APARTMENT OWNER.

I have two apartments which I rent out to people visiting Berlin. I am also a massage therapist, offering holistic massage therapy at a studio in Prenzlauerberg.

I have been travelling and living in many places in the world and had some adventures including cycling the Silk road from Pakistan into China and returning to europe via the trans-Mongolian express. More recently in April 2011 I walked the french route of the  Camino de santiago de Compostela, covering some 800 km. I love meeting new people and enjoy being a host to visitors.

While check-in time is generally flexible, check-in does need some advance co-ordination as we need for someone to be there for you when you get here if we're travelling ourselves (which is usually the case when we rent out our flat). If we have guests before or after you, we will need time for cleaning which means you might have to leave in the morning around 10/11 or might not be able to arrive before the afternoon around 4.","It's a great and easy place to discover Berlin from with many downtown places within walking distance and the subway station a mere block away. The U2 subway will take you to all the major downtown destinations such as Alexanderplatz, Mitte district with Brandenburg Gate, Potsdamer Platz and Zoologischer Garten. The popular Alexanderplatz and Hackescher Markt areas are within 20 minutes walking distance or easy to reach by streetcar. Several places around offer bike rental. The airports can be reached by public transportation within 35 minutes (Tegel) and an hour (Schönefeld) at a cost of around 3€. You must change busses / trains once in order to get here. Parking is possible at 7€ per day in a garage around the corner.","This is our own apartment which we rent out while on vacations, so we are sure you will feel right at home and enjoy the amenities, books, music that come with a fully equipped place. Have breakfast on the balcony, enjoy your coffee on the window board overlooking the street or feel free to cook dinner.","We are happy to provide you with information about the place and the area in advance. While you are here, you will have our apartment all by yourselves, but our next door neighbors are available for your needs and questions.","We are leaving a little booklet with rules & recommendations on the kitchen desk for you. These are the most basic rules: - We will be asking of a copy / photo of your passport after confirmation. This is our home, please understand that we wish to know who is going to live in it. - Smoking is allowed on the balcony. - No parties or guests, please, especially none that you have just met. - Always lock both locks on the apartment door when you're leaving, even if you are just going downstairs or when you are inside. - Feel free to use our Wifi, but refrain from illegal downloads (film, music...).

Choosing this place I attached great importance on lots of light, very central and quiet location with balcony and lift. I equipped this place with all the amenities that I like to find when I am travelling myself. 



At the same time I am not overly pretentious, but I feel most comfortable whenever the place is clean and clear. 

I am also delighted about every little amenity which makes my stay comfortable and which gives me a quick orientation. 



For my guests I followed this idea: mineral water, coffee, tea to start with, cooling and cooking opportunities, ingredients such as salt, pepper, oil, vinegar … and a dish washer – all this you can take for granted. As well as convenient city maps, umbrella (just in case), recommendations for almost everything: cafés, bars, clubs, museums, all kind of transport facilities and handy hints – even off the beaten tourist track.    



My guests can expect: washing machine, flat iron, ironing board, and for activities inside the apartment after a long day trip or a hard working day a few delivery services for lovely meals and drinks. 



During busy times of course I am always accessible via mobile phone. I am open minded regarding special requests. Do not hesitate to ask. 



My personal interests: photography, friends, swimming, theatre.

I WILL DO MY BEST TO REPLY TO YOUR REQUEST IN MAXIMUN 4 HOURS.



I am 35 years old, living since 2017 between Spain and Germany. 

I have a 3 rooms apartment in the center of Berlin(DE) and a Mountain Home in Granada(ES).



My apartment in the center of Berlin, close to Potsdamer Platz.

It is very close to almost all the sights, you can walk everywhere from here, also the metro is just a few steps from my door step. 

Its also very convenient to have a supermarket just downstairs on the building and a Shopping Mall (MALL OF BERLIN) just across the street.



The Mountain Home in Granada is 25 minutes to the center of Granada, up in the mountains in a Little and Brightful village called Güéjar Sierra, also only 20 Minutes to the top of Sierra Nevada. Laying at precise 1000meters (3000ft), Güéjar Sierra is quiet and picturesque and at the same time active and full with options for outdoors activities from simple walking to hardest climbing.

 

Both Places are my Home Sweet Home and I love going to both places despite of the difference of the 2 locations. I which you can enjoy mt set even when I'm not around.

Hi,



I am looking forward hosting people from all over the world and hope to be able to make your stay as comfortable as it can be. I like social people, but do respect your privacy. Being a frequent traveller myself, I understand you might like company, or privacy, depending on your mood, today.



I like self-made music, languages and self-made cooking. We have a piano and a guitar in the kitchen / living room.



We speak Italian, German, Spanish and English fluently.

I love to take b/w photos, to bake my own bread, and I love to live in this area of Berlin. 



My name is greek and means fountain. If you want to pronounce it right, take ""Yipee"", cut it in the center and swap to Pee-Yee. Guess why our daughter has the name Zoi. It means ""life"" and ""fountain"" and ""life"" have the same name day in the greek calender...

I WILL DO MY BEST TO REPLY TO YOUR REQUEST IN MAXIMUN 4 HOURS.



I am 35 years old, living since 2017 between Spain and Germany. 

I have a 3 rooms apartment in the center of Berlin(DE) and a Mountain Home in Granada(ES).



My apartment in the center of Berlin, close to Potsdamer Platz.

It is very close to almost all the sights, you can walk everywhere from here, also the metro is just a few steps from my door step. 

Its also very convenient to have a supermarket just downstairs on the building and a Shopping Mall (MALL OF BERLIN) just across the street.



The Mountain Home in Granada is 25 minutes to the center of Granada, up in the mountains in a Little and Brightful village called Güéjar Sierra, also only 20 Minutes to the top of Sierra Nevada. Laying at precise 1000meters (3000ft), Güéjar Sierra is quiet and picturesque and at the same time active and full with options for outdoors activities from simple walking to hardest climbing.

 

Both Places are my Home Sweet Home and I love going to both places despite of the difference of the 2 locations. I which you can enjoy mt set even when I'm not around.

In the east it is joined to a new long-drawn-out park that connects it with Kreuzberg, not far from the former Tempelhof airport, whose free runways are now used for many sports. To the west it borders the residential district of Wilmersdorf. At its heart is the large Schöneberger Rathaus where Kennedy gave his famous speech.","Airport:  From Airport Tegel it takes about 14 min.by taxi to get to the apartment and costs about € 26. By public transportation it takes about 25 minutes. Take the Bus ""X9"" to the train station ""Zoologischer Garten / Zoo"" and then the bus ""M46"" (direction ""Südkreuz"") until bus-station ""Motzstr."" From there it`s perhaps 200m.

You can also take the ""S-Bahn / railway"" until ""Innsbrucker-Platz"" and from there the ""U4"". But sometimes the S-Bahn is not driving. So I recommend to take the underground.

Or is it the U1 directly to Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain with their lively night life? For shopping enthusiasts, the KaDeWe and the Kurfürstendamm at Wittenberg Platz are also only 10 minutes far. Or you just take the Metrobus M46, which runs every 10 min. driving off from the side street (Martin-Luther-Str.) to the Zoologischer Garten (Zoo) and the Southern Cross (Südkreuz).

Feel free to use whatever you need. Basic condiments and spices for cooking are of course also available. Everything necessary for baking is also there since I like to bake.

It is important to me that the guest is left alone and only given information when it is wanted.","A house rules there though and this is hanging out by the landlord in the stairwell, but in all previous guests this really was not necessary.

I'm usually based in Berlin but travel often for research and art projects. I'm always happy to explore new places, revisit places, and meet new people, and to be a host: for most of my adult life I have often had friends and friends of friends staying on my couch whenever I lived, and would take them around discover the city as much as I could. 



In the past half year I was away for long research trips in East Asia and the US, but am back in Berlin now in my beloved apartment in the heart of beautiful Neukölln, hands down my favourite place in Germany. I really love my neighbourhood! 

My flatmate moved away recently and so now half of my apartment (two rooms: one bedroom and one studio / living room) has opened up to host guests, just in time for when the weather gets really lovely in Berlin and my neighbourhood is even more flourishing than usual :)

Since the year 2000 I live and work as a designer in Berlin, mostly in Kreuzberg and Neukölln. I do know a lot of interesting spots to recommend in Berlin, but even for me there is still so much to explore in this fabulous city.



If I´m not in Berlin I travel a lot. My favorite countries are Thailand, Indonesia, Marocco, Cuba, Italy and Spain. Most of my trips got me to Spain.



My favorite cities around the world are Bangkok, Istanbul, Madrid, Sevilla, Barcelona and Essouira.



I let my apartment since beginning 2011. In designing a pure and decent Berlin styled apartment my goal was to give a taste of my creativity without taking to much space. 



If you are my guest you will see that I am an straightforward and helpful host.

Many years ago I began dedicating myself to issues surrounding poverty and the environment after an extended trip through Asia and Africa in 2000. I began to wonder – what if you could harness the power of the free market to solve the problems of poverty, hunger, inequality?

My personal journey has taken me to many places on this planet in many capacities. As a young student growing up in the United States during the height of the cold war, I could not phantom why people on the other side of the world would want to kill me. Conflict and conflict management in international affairs became an underlying theme in everything I did. I visited the Soviet Union to dispel the myth. Later I became a professor of transition theory at the University in Kiev, Ukraine, worked in the State Department of the United States, launched an internet company, established a foundation and consulted international organizations such as the OSCE and the Council of Europe. I discovered there are many ways to tackle conflict. But where could I have the most impact?

Now, I am focusing my efforts nearly 100% on Social Business as a Social Entrepreneur – a pioneering model for nothing less than a new, humane form of capitalism. I understood that conflict prevention starts with reducing poverty. I have always liked the motto “Doing well by doing good” and am motivated by triple bottom line metrics – people planet profit.
